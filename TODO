1. Add expectation value paths/options

   raw_circuit      -> Noise -> observable (property of density matrix or of statevector)
   compiled_circuit -> Noise -> observable
     circuit -> save density matrix at end

    observable_metrics(raw_qiskit, compiled_qiskit, sim_settings):
        raw_qiskit.save_density_matrix()
        compiled_qiskit.save_density_matrix()

        # no noise
        raw ->
        compiled ->
          # if exp value
          statevector from circuit
          # if HOPF/counts of circuit measurement
          - first heavy bitstrings, statevector sim of circuit, counts/filter
          - then statevector sim of circuit, count which are heavy from prior
        # with noise
        raw
        compiled
          # if exp value
          Aer sim, density matrix,
           # if HOPF/counts of circuit measurement
             - first heavy bitstrings, statevector sim of circuit, counts/filter
            - then statevector sim of circuit with noise, count which are heavy from prior


2. Add documention (the how to's in README)
------------------
8. Import legacy data
-----------------
3. Add reporter that converts to flat view of performance
4. Add plotter helpers
5. Add PR helper

--- Demo here
6. Add github actions
7. Run in parallel with main repo, then switch when ready
